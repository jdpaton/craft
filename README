Craft - idiomatic build tool for Python
---------------------------------------

Craft is like Makefile, except everything is in native Python. 

An example ``crafty.py``::

    from craft import task

    @task
    def cake():
      """ Prints cake """
      print('cake time')

    @task
    def bar():
      """ Prints bar """
      print('bar')

    @task
    def foo():
      print("Hi, I'm foo")

Running ``craft -h`` in the directory containing ``crafty.py`` will
show the list of available tasks. Example::

    usage: craft [-h] [task [task ...]]

    positional arguments:
      task

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit

    Available tasks:

    - cake: Prints cake 
    - bar: Prints bar 
    - foo: 

As you can see, the docstring for each ``@task`` function will then be represented
in the help output.
